<p align="justify">The start of the program is given by a welcome message, in addition to information about the game and the option to start it. When started, the first question will appear and, after the user's response, they will receive a feedback and his current score. After answering the 5 Trivia questions, the program will tell whether or not the user is a "Nerd Raiz", if your score is greater than or equal to 3.</br>

<p>Code made in Replit with external Linux commands :)</p>
